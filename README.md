# Bayesian-Invariant-Risk-Minmization
This is the source code for the CVPR 2022 paper entitled [Bayesian Invariant Risk Minmization]().

Our implementation is based on the source code of [IRM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InvariantRiskMinimization)  [ColoredObject](https://github.com/Faruk-Ahmed/predictive_group_invariance), and [CifarMnist](https://github.com/HKUST-MLResearch/IRMBed).

# Requirements 
Our code works with the following environment.
* `python=3.7.0`
* `pytorch=1.3.1`

To install the necessary packages for the project, please run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
